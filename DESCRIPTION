Description: Contains kernel smoothing tools designed for use by historical
    dialectologists and philologists for exploring spatial and temporal patterns
    in noisy historical language data, such as that obtained from historical texts.
    The main way in which these might differ from other implementations of kernel
    smoothing is that they assume that the function (linguistic variable) being
    explored has the form of the relative frequency of a series of discrete
    possibilities (linguistic variants). This package also offers a way of exploring
    distributions in 2-dimensional space and in time with separate kernels, and
    tools for identifying appropriate bandwidths for these.
